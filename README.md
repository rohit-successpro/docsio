# Successpro docs

This repository powers the [Successpro](https://docsio.co) documentation site, built with [Docsio](https://docsio.co).

## How to edit

You can edit these docs in two places:

1. **In Docsio** — visual editor with live preview, AI agent, instant publish.
2. **In this repo** — push commits to the configured branch. Docsio rebuilds automatically.

Changes in either place sync to the other. Your published site updates within a minute of a commit landing.

## What's here

- `docs/` — your documentation pages, as markdown with frontmatter
- `static/img/` — user-uploaded images (logo, favicon, screenshots referenced by pages)
- `docsio.json` — theme colors and navigation config
- `.docsioignore` — what Docsio explicitly ignores

## What's NOT here

The Docusaurus theme template, build scaffolding, and any other rendering code is managed by Docsio and not committed to this repo. If you want to write a custom theme component, you'll need to do that in the Docsio editor — it stays in your project but isn't surfaced in git.
